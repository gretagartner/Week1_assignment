        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
    </section>

    <paragraph> 
        I am 25 years old and will be 26 in November, that makes my zodiac a Scorpio. I was born in Rochester, MN
        and grew up in rural Zumbrota my whole life. I moved to Santa Rosa, CA 
        in 2021 after graduating from Vet Tech school and worked at an animal sanctuary. While I was there,
        I adopted a cat named Cheese. He has an old eye and ear injury from an unknown trauma
         and is now mostly blind as a result. Animals are a very important part of my life.

        I moved to Hastings, MN in January 2025 with my boyfriend, Storm. Together 
        we have two cats, Cheese who I mentioned above and Leon who we adopted this spring. I volunteer
        with Camp Companion in Rochester and that's where I met Leon. He was at PetSmart
        for 3 months with no applicants so I took him home and the rest is history.

        <h2>My Goals for this Course</h2>
    </section>

    <paragraph>
        In this course I have few goals. I would like to not only learn 
        about the intricacies of web design with CSS and HTML but be able to demonstrate 
        these skills in a professional way. By the end of this course, I want to know how to build a
        website that reflects who I am and my personality/interests. 
        I am hoping through each week I will get closer to these goals and increase my knowledge.
